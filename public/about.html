  <p class="info">Set in a 19th century European village, this stop-motion, animated feature follows the story of
    Victor (voiced by
    Johnny Depp), a young man who is whisked away to the underworld and wed to a mysterious Corpse Bride, while his
    real bride, Victoria, waits bereft in the land of the living.</p>

  <p class="info">Though life in the Land of the Dead proves to be a lot more colorful than his strict Victorian
    upbringing, Victor
    learns that there is nothing in this world, or the next, that can keep him away from his one true love.</p>
